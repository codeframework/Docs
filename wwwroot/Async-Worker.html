    <h1 id="asyncworker">AsyncWorker</h1>
<p>The CODE Framework is an extensive set of utilities that can make your life easier. The tool I want to talk about today is the AsyncWorker. This little gem can be found in the CODE.Framework.Wpf.Mvvm name space and provides a convenient way to execute code on a background thread without having to recall the syntax required to go through the application dispatcher to invoke and control a background thread.
The typical syntax for using the AsyncWorker is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C#">AsyncWorker.Execute(()=&gt;
	{
		var response = null;
		//code to execute on the background thread
		return response;
	},
	response =&gt;
	{
		//do something on your UI thread with the response
	}
);
</code></pre>
<p>The concept is simple, any code you want to run on the background thread is passed into the first parameter (block of code), which will then be run on a background thread and returned to the second parameter (block of code) which runs on the UI thread. Clean and simple background thread execution.
But this is just the beginning of the feature set of the AsyncWorker. There are three optional parameters that provide much more functionality. The most common one is a reference to the current ViewModel. So adding to the code above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C#">AsyncWorker.Execute(()=&gt;
	{
		var response = null;
		//code to execute on the background thread
		return response;
	},
	response =&gt;
	{
		//do something on your UI thread with the response
	}, 
        this
);
</code></pre>
<p>Offically called the statusObject parameter, the “this” keyword will pass a reference to the current view model. The AsyncWorker will take this parameter and set the CODE Framework ViewModel property called ModelStatus. Here is where it gets interesting, the standard CODE Framework Metro theme has a progress indicator who’s visibility bound to the ModelStatus property. This means that the CODE Framework will display the progress indicator while the AsycWorker is waiting on the background thread to run and automatically hide it when the background thread has completed. So easy background threading with automatic wait indicator, pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Related to the statusObject parameter is the ModelStatus parameter. This optional parameter accepts an enumeration of the type ModelStatus, with your choices being: Saving, Loading, Ready, and Unknown.  The default Metro theme will use the same wait indicator for Saving and Loading, but using this parameter and a custom ModelStatus visibility converter (beyond the scope of this article) it is possible to create a theme that will display different wait indicators for each of the choices. Looking at our code we now have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C#">AsyncWorker.Execute(()=&gt;
	{
		var response = null;
		//code to execute on the background thread
		return response;
	},
	response =&gt;
	{
		//do something on your UI thread with the response
	},   
        this, 
        ModelStatus.Loading
);
</code></pre>
<p>Now there are times when you want to run a process on a scheduled time, say to periodically update a dashboard. Here is where our next AsyncWorker parameter, “interval”, comes into play.</p>
<pre><code class="language-C#">AsyncWorker.Execute(()=&gt;
	{
		var response = null;
		//code to execute on the background thread
		return response;
	},
	response =&gt;
	{
		//do something on your UI thread with the response
	},   
        TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)
        this, 
        ModelStatus.Loading,
);
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see here the “interval” parameter accepts a System TimeSpan. The code above would cause our code in the first parameter to be executed every 5 minutes. Of course you may be thinking that this is nice, but how do I stop it? Not to worry there is one last parameter worth discussing that gives us full control of the scheduled execution.</p>
<p>Called “processId”, this little known gem is a Guid that you create and pass into the AsyncWorker. The AsyncWorker will use this Guid to reference your scheduled block of code. Keep in mind that you will want to define this as a global variable so that you can access this Guid from other parts of your view model, so it would appear something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C#">private Guid _myProcessId = Guid.NewGuid();
void DoMyStuff()
{
       AsyncWorker.Execute(()=&gt;
	{
		var response = null;
		//code to execute on the background thread
		return response;
	},
	response =&gt;
	{
		//do something on your UI thread with the response
	}, 
        TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
        this, 
        _myProcessId
       );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have fired off the AsyncWorker, given it an interval to run on, and provided a process id to control it we can now use the other AsyncWorker functions, PauseContinuousProcess, ResumeContinuousProcess, and StopContinuousProcess. Each of these methods accepts a Guid used to identify the process id to control. So if we wanted to have a button to stop the AsyncWorker created above we would have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C#">void StopDoingMyStuff()
{
	AsyncWorker.StopContinuousProcess(_myProcessId);
}
</code></pre>
<p>AsyncWorker also supports firing code that runs on the foreground thread, while running background operations. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C#">AsyncWorker.Execute(()=&gt;
	{
		var response = null;
		//code to execute on the background thread

                AsyncWorker.OnForegroundThread(() =&gt; {
                        ItemsProgressed = 200; // View model property bound to the UI
                   });

		return response;
	},
	response =&gt;
	{
		//do something on your UI thread with the response
	}
);
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to interact with object that have UI thread affinity (anything bound to the UI, or any WPF control object) from a background thread.</p>
<p>So there it is, the AsyncWorker in all it’s CODEing glory, enjoy!</p>
